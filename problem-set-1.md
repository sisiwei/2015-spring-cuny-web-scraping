# Problem Set 1
<i>Assigned: April 23rd</i>
<br/><b>Due: April 29th at 11:59 p.m. (6 days to complete)</b>

Please remember the [Academy Honesty policy on problem sets](http://cdn.cs50.net/2014/fall/lectures/0/w/syllabus/syllabus.html#academic_honesty). If you are ever confused about what is okay and what isn't, ask me. 

## Goal
The goal of this problem set is to familiarize you with the very basics of programming so that we can jump straight into web scraping next week. Any type of programming you do will require familiarity with the basic concepts of variables, functions, lists, if statements and loops. 

## Problems

1. Write a function, named "copycat", that simply prints out whatever input it's given.

2. Write a function, named "addition", that when given any three numbers, will print out the total sum of all three numbers.

3. Write a function, named "conversion", that when given the Fahrenheit temperature, will print out what it is in Celsius. The formula you can use is: ```C = (F â€“ 32) * 5/9.```

4. Write a function, named "find_the_max", that given any three numbers, will print out the bigger number. Python has the native ability to do this, using the function ```max()```. Do not use it. Instead write this from scratch.

5. Given the following data, write a function, named "total_students", that calculates how many <b>total</b> students are enrolled in Hogwarts.

```python
pupils_by_year = [["first years", 40], ["second years", 40], ["third years", 38], ["fourth years", 35], ["fifth years", 30], ["sixth years", 29], ["seventh years", 23]]
```

## Updates

- April 26: Added the word "total" to #5 to clarify that the "total_students" function should figure out how many students are now at Hogwarts in total.
